        <div>
            <p>A lifelong night owl, P.J. Night often works furiously into
                the wee hours of the morning, writing down spooky tales
                and dreaming up new stories of the supernatural and
                otherworldly. Although P.J's whereabouts are unknown
                at this time, we suspect the author lives in a drafty, old
                mansion where the floorboards creak when no one is
                there and the flickering candlelight creates shadows that
                creep along the walls. We truly wish we could tell you
                more, but we've been sworn to Keep P.J's identity a 
                secret...and it's a secret we will take to our graves!</p>
