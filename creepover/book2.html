            <h2>Book#2 You Can't Come in Here!</h2>
            <p>Emily tries to introduce her new friends to her old ones in this scary You're
               Invited to a Creepover Tale
               
               Emily Hunter loves hanging out with her new neighbors. from their decked-out
               rec room to their almost-professional guitar playing, Drew and Vicky Strig are
               super cool.

               The only bummer is that Drew and Vicky are homeschooled and Emily's other
               friends haven't gotten to know them yet. So Emily comes up with a plan for
               everyone to meet--a big party and sleepover at her house! But as Emily gets 
               ready for the party, she begins to wonder about Drew and Vicky. They won't let
               Emily into certain rooms in their house. And a wolf howls on their lawn every
               night. Is it only Emily's overactive imagination or are the new neighbors more
               than just a little strange?

               This terrifying tale is a level 4 on the Creep-O-Meter.
