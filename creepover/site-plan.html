      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I'm here today at Simon & Schuster to offer my services to help advertise their latest book series “You're Invited to a Creepover”.  This series has only released a few books so far but has already become a best seller, and with me on the team, I would design a webpage for the series which would help advertise the series to more readers.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience that reads this series are mostly kids and tweens, especially those that enjoy reading the "Goosebumps" books. With the website we can reach out to more kids, espcially those that enjoy playing on the computer.The website will be accessable by desktop, laptop, and any kind of mobile device.</p>  <!-- change this -->
